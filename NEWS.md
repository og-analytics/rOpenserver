# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9015
* use `.OpenServer` (dot-OpenServer) instead of `OpenServer` for the R6 class
* new `OpenServerR6` class inherits from `.OpenServer` class. We will not use old `OpenServer` because collides with `openserver()` function.
* new function `newOpenServer()` that represents `.OpenServer$new()` or `OpenServerR6$new()`.
* keep `setOpenServer()` as it does the same as `newOpenServer()`.
* update R6 class with a structure that does not produce warnings or notes
* fix roxygen documentation for R6 class so we don't get warnings.
* prevent R6 warnings by adding roxygen line in DESCRIPTION
* new function `get_all_models_by_ext()` to retrieve all models residing in package
* split `core.R` in class, functions
* add new zip functions to `utils.R`
* disable .onAttach() in `zzz.R`
* move conversion functions to `dataobjects.R`
* use package example in `README`
* remove unneeded packages from `DESCRIPTION`.
* remove `BiocStyle` package that provided nicer `css`. It was making installation complicated.
* create `common.R` for unit tests functions.
* add while-loop time delay that works in unit tests when CPU is busy in `test-status.R`
* kill dormant processes before unit test status
* reorganize unit test for status check
* change calls to OpenServer constructors in vignettes
* add note in `README` for `RDCOMClient` installation
* add new functions to `pkgdown`
* add Makefile because `pkgdown` requires building README, install package before building the documentation website.
* change repository from `github.com/f0nzie/rOpenserver` to `github.com/og-analytics/rOpenserver`. Make changes in README, DESCRIPTION and `_pkgdown.yml` files.
* TODO: complete data objects for GAP and MBAL tests
* TODO: check long vector in well test, when most rows are zeros. This is addressed in rProsper as well.


# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9014
* enhance list of IPM objects in process list in read_openserver_status(). ignore case of object in task list.
* replace delay using Sys.sleep() in tests with while loop because sleep() doesn't work in this case.
* add test for DoSet


# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9013
* Heat Transfer Coefficient example

# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9011
* New `_pkgdown.yml`
* Notebooks derived from `demo` scripts
* Added section in pkgdown for *Notebooks*
* License switch to MIT


# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9010
* Prosper example horizontal well with three independent variables
* Prosper example horizontal well with two independent variables

# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9009
* add demo examples to run with demo()

# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9008
* Hello World example for MBAL
* Including BiocStyle. https://bioc.ism.ac.jp/packages/3.0/bioc/vignettes/BiocStyle/inst/doc/HtmlStyle.html. Not yet active. Works only standalone.

# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9007
* Hello World examples for Prosper and GAP

# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9006
* Hide `RDCOMClient` function `createCOMReference()` with `@keywords internal`

# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9005
* Stick to R6 style for initialization `OpenServer$new()`
* Improve unit tests
* Copy models for testing
* Do not test R6 to S3 methods that were generated by `R62S3` because they are stored in in a local environment.


# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9004
* After copying the example in `README` to a unit test, getting this error when using this form of `DoCmd` and `DoGet`: `DoCmd(prosper_server, open_cmd)`.
Here is the output:

```
> library(rOpenserver)
> 
> test_check("rOpenserver")
-- 1. Error: README code behaves the same in tests (@test_readme.R#26)  --------------------------------------
object 'open_cmd' not found
Backtrace:
 1. R62S3:::DoCmd(prosper_server, open_cmd)
 4. private$get_app_name(command)
 5. base::toupper(string_value)
```

This form of command using S3 dispatch works in the **README** but fails in the unit tests. Why? Even adding `object` as an argument to the method in the `OpenServer` class doesn't help either. Because the package `R62S3` conveniently generates the S3 methods for R6 classes but through the environment, which is not available at unit test time.

* Recompiling `testthat` from source
* Add simple test to check `DoCmd` works. It doesn't. Still getting error at the unit test.

# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9003

* Documenting function `setOpenServer` that acts as a OpenServer constructor. 


# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9002
* trying with different option to obtaina constructor of `OpenServer` without using `OpensServer$new()`. Attempts unsuccesful witout sacrificing documentation, and renaming main class to `.OpenServer`, that is *dot OpenServer*
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.


# rOpenserver 0.1.0.9000
* The original `openserver` package works fine but didn't have any roxygen2 documentation.
